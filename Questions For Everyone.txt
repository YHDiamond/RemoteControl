We are done with both the circuitry and the software of the controller. All that needs to be done is to design an ergonomic enclosure.

On the car side, we are simply outputting the joystick X, Y, and button state to the serial port and not actually doing anything with it yet. In order to continue with the software, we need to know:

What type of drive system is being used?
- four wheels; four wheel independent drive - easy hardware, hard software
- four wheels; four wheel drive, front differential with steering column - hard hardware, easy software - differential + steering column + powered front wheels is quite difficult
- four wheels; front wheel drive, front differential drive with steering column - effectively identical to previous but rear wheels are free spinning rather than driven
- four wheels; rear wheel drive, front differential with steering column - medium hardware, easy software - front wheels don't need to be powered but still need to build a steering column and differential
- three wheels; two wheel drive, single wheel in rear - easy hardware, medium software
- three wheels; two wheel drive, single wheel in front - identical to previous
- three wheels; one wheel drive, single wheel in front - hard hardware, medium software
- three wheels; one wheel drive, single wheel in front - identical to previous

What voltage is being used to power the car?

The joystick has an integrated button, and software handling has been implemented. Any interesting ideas for what to do with it?
